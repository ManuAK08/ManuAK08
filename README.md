# Hi, I’m Akanksha 👋

I turn **messy customer behavior data into retention and performance actions teams actually use**.

With **6+ years of experience across product, business, and operations analytics**, my strength lies in bridging gaps—between vague stakeholder asks and concrete logic, between metrics and decisions, and between how systems *should* work and how they actually do.

I’m particularly strong at **optimization**: spotting weak links in data flows, product processes, and cross-team handoffs, then redesigning them into clearer, repeatable workflows. Whether it’s customer churn, category performance, or operational reliability, I focus on building analytics that **reduce friction, scale decision-making, and survive real-world constraints**.

I’ve worked with **enterprise-scale data**, partnered closely with product and engineering teams, and I think explicitly in **trade-offs—not just metrics**.

## What I Work On
- Translating ambiguous business and product questions into **clear analytical logic and decision frameworks**
- Product and category analytics: **KPI design, performance monitoring, and optimization**
- Customer behavior, retention, and health modeling that feeds **repeatable operating cadences**
- Operational analytics focused on **data quality, reliability, and process efficiency**
- Research, documentation, and synthesis that **connect dots across teams and unblock execution**


---

## How I Work
- Business-first, but technically grounded  
- Pragmatic over theoretical  
- **Experiment-driven**: pilots first, scale after learning  
- Strong believer in **A/B testing, cohort analysis, and customer segmentation** for decision validation  
- Explainable systems over black boxes  
- Decisions over dashboards

## Tools I Use (and How I Use Them)

**SQL (Primary Tool)**  
My default tool for analysis. I use SQL for **data extraction, feature engineering, metric definition, and building reliable analytical datasets** using CTEs, window functions, and joins—ensuring logic is transparent and reproducible.

**Python (When Scale or Complexity Demands It)**  
I use it for **large datasets, advanced feature engineering, statistical analysis, and modeling** when SQL alone becomes limiting. Enables deeper exploration, iteration, and validation beyond query-level analysis.

**Excel (Fast, Focused Analysis)**  
I use it intentionally for **customer segmentation, cohort analysis, what-if analysis, Goal Seek, regression, and pivot-driven exploration**, especially when datasets are manageable and rapid insight generation matters.

**Dashboards (Decision Communication)**  
Comfortable using both Power BI and Tableau to **operationalize insights**—not to discover them. Dashboards are built once metrics are validated, to support stakeholder alignment and recurring decision workflows.

**Integration & Workflow**  
Comfortable working with **APIs, Git-based workflows, Jupyter, and cloud data platforms (AWS)** to integrate data sources and support end-to-end analytics delivery.

## Focus Areas
- Product and business analytics that **drive prioritization and trade-offs**
- Category and revenue performance analysis with an **optimization mindset**
- Customer retention, churn, and lifecycle analytics that **feed repeatable actions**
- Operational analytics focused on **data quality, reliability, and process efficiency**
- Designing analytics systems that **scale decisions, not just reports**


---

## A Win That Represents My Style
I turn one-off analyses into **repeatable decision workflows** that teams can run without friction.
